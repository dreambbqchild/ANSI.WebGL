BBEBEEEEEEEEBBBBEEBEBbbbboooooooooooo whap whap ka thun ka THun kA ThUn!

One thing that always impressed me back in my BBS days was the art that you'd see when you logged on to a board.
To this day I have no idea how good ANSI art is made, I mean, I know how ANSI art is made otherwise I wouldn't
have been able to start this project :p but anyway, I loves the stuff! Since my art is Software Engineering, I
thought why not write a ANSI rendering utility? I did find other ones that use the HTML5 canvas element as the
back end to their rendering. This one is powered by WebGL which I'm optimistic will prove most useful
as a flexible springboard to add features to!
